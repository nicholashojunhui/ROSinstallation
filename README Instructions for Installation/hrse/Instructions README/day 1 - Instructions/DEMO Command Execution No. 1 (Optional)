Command Execution Sequence Instructions for Laser Scan DEMO

1. Launch Gazebo in TurtleBot3 World

	$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

2. Run node that allow the TB3 to explore around and at the same time, send required data to your ThingSpeak Channel (use reference template to construct node)

	$ rosrun hrse TS_demo1.py

*ensure that your python codes are in the src folder of your hrse package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x TS_demo1.py)


3. Check if your ThingSpeak Channel receives the data from your run node

4. You would have noticed that the autonomous exploring function is not working well due to the lag time caused by the sending of data to ThingSpeak. Main reason why this happens: ThingSpeak free account does not provide fast data transfers (hence the lag time); you need to upgrade to paid account to enable real-time data transfers

5. Once done, you can export your collected data in CSV
