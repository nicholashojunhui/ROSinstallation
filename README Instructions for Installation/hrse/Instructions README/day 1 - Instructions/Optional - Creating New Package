1. Change to the source space directory of the catkin workspace:

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src

2. Use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package
called â€˜new_package' which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:

$ catkin_create_pkg new_package std_msgs rospy roscpp

3. Build the packages in the catkin workspace:

$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make

4. Add the workspace to your ROS environment by sourcing the
generated setup file:

$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
