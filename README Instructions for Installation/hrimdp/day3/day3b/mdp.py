Markov Decision Processes (Chapter 17)

First we define an MDP, and the special case of a GridMDP, in which
states are laid out in a 2-dimensional grid. We also represent a policy
as a dictionary of {state: action} pairs, and a Utility function as a
dictionary of {state: number} pairs. We then define the value_iteration
and policy_iteration algorithms.
