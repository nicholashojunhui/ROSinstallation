Note that this installation is for Leap Motion Controller to be used for Ubuntu 20.04

1. Go to the following weblink and download the SDK file (For ROS in Ubuntu, download the Linux version):

   https://developer.leapmotion.com/legacy-v2/

2. Once downloaded, unzip the zip file, Leap_Motion_SDK_Linux_2.3.1.tgz

3. Install the required package

   $ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx

4a. Open terminal, change directory and run the following command:

   $ sudo dpkg --install Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb
   
4b. If you have an error during the above Linux installation, first uninstall the leap programme:

   $ sudo dpkg -r leap

5. Type the following command:

   $ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/leapd.service
   
6. Copy and paste the below in the nano editor:

   [Unit]
   Description=LeapMotion Daemon
   After=syslog.target
   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/sbin/leapd
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

7. After which, save contents (CTRL+O then ENTER), and exit (CTRL+X)

8. Still using the terminal, execute the two commands from that same terminal:

   $ sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/leapd.service /etc/systemd/system/leapd.service
   $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

9. All is right now and we can properly install. Open terminal, change directory and run the following command:

   $ sudo dpkg --install Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb

10. Ensure Step 8 is completed without errors first. Once done, go to the folder that was unzip in Step 2. Click on LeapSDK -> Lib.

   There are 3 files involved in the next step. They are:
   - Leap.py
   - LeapPython.so (under x64 folder)
   - libLeap.so (under x64 folder)

11. Copy and paste these 3 files in your /home/issuser/catkin_ws/src/leap_motion/LeapSDK/lib
      /usr/local/lib/python<version>/site-packages/. 

12. Now you can try to open the Leap Motion GUI

   $ LeapControlPanel

13. If the daemon is unable to run, type the following to restart the leap programme and try again:

   $ sudo service leapd restart
