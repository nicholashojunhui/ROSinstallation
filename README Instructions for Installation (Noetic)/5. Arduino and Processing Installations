Arduino in Linux:

1. Make the OpenCR USB port be able to upload the Arduino IDE program without root permission.

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR/master/99-opencr-cdc.rules
$ sudo cp ./99-opencr-cdc.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
$ sudo udevadm trigger

2. Since the OpenCR libraries is built for 32 bit platform, 64 bit PC needs the 32 bit compiler relevants for the ArduinoIDE.

$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev:i386

3. Extract the downloaded file to the desired folder and execute the installation file from the terminal. In this case, the example shown below makes the folder tools in the user’s top folder (~/). This folder will act as the Arduino IDE folder.

$ cd ~/Desktop/arduino-1.8.13
$ sudo ./install.sh

4. Set the file path of installed Arduino IDE as an absolute path named PATH in the bashrc file. Here recommends to use gedit editor. (Use another editor, if necessary.) Finally, source it to apply the changes.

$ gedit ~/.bashrc
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/tools/arduino-1.8.13
$ source ~/.bashrc

5. After Arduino IDE is run, click File then Preferences in the top menu of the IDE. When the Preferences window appears, copy and paste following link to the Additional Boards Manager URLs textbox. (This step may take about 20 min.)

6. Click Tools then Board then Boards Manager. Type OpenCR into the textbox to find the OpenCR by ROBOTIS package. After it finds out, click Install. After the installation, “INSTALLED” will be appeared. See if OpenCR Board is now on the list of Tools then Board. Click this to import the OpenCR Board source.

7. After programming with the Arduino IDE and uploading the program to the OpenCR, the OpenCR will be restarted and be reconnected. At the same moment, the modem-related packages of the Linux will send the AT command to manage the device. Thus indicates an connection error on the OpenCR, so this step should be done previously.

$ sudo apt-get purge modemmanager
